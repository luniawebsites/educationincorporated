							<p><img src="images/logo-shield.png" class="shield" alt="" />Edu Inc is a boutique private school with a unique perspective on education. With our very small classes, each child is assured personal attention from our qualified and caring teachers. As a mainstream GDE registered and Umalusi accredited school, our Matrics write the same exams as the other private IEB schools you are familiar with. We’re extremely proud of our 100% pass rate and look forward to answering any questions you may have about Edu Inc.</p>

											<p>The modern child expects (and is expected to) have their own viewpoints, opinions and freedom to ask questions, especially when it comes to upholding their fundamental rights. We refer to this as your child’s voice or your child having a voice.</p>
											<p>Many children are not equipped with the vocabulary required to express their evolving feelings. In chapter 5 of our book “Educating Your 22nd Century Child” we discuss the value of your child’s voice and how you can learn to hear them better.</p>

											<p>One-on-one teaching in our very small classes necessitates that we charge more than a government school would. However, our fees are in line with what you’d expect to pay at a neighboring private school with 25 children in a class. Take a moment to download and read our prospectus and see for yourself what our classes and school look like. The best interest of the children is our highest priority and we’d like you to come and visit and see for yourself.</p>

											<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Edu Inc is a mainstream IEB school registered with the GDE and Umalusi. It is alarming how many families are unaware they have entrusted their child's education to an unregistered school. In <strong>chapter 8</strong> of our book <strong>'Educating Your 22nd Century Child'</strong> we'll walk you through the critical items to verify before enroling your child in any school. From Umalusi acceditation to teachers being SACE registered, we'll assist you with an essential check list.</p>
											<p>The book also contains many other chapters intended to address the concerns and questions we know you may be wrestling with. This is one of the biggest decisions a parent has to make, so it's important that it's an informed decision.</p>
